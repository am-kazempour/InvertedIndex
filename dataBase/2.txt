Large language models (LLMs) have quickly gained popularity since OpenAI released ChatGPT for public access. Since then, people have used ChatGPT for fun, creative, and useful purposes. If you’ve dreamed about using ChatGPT as your Python coding mentor, then keep on reading.
Using ChatGPT as your mentor doesn’t mean that you should try to build a software solution without knowing anything about programming. Instead, you’ll focus on using ChatGPT as a learning tool. It probably can’t replace you as a programmer, but it can help you to improve your code and learn in the process.
In this section and throughout the tutorial, you’ll encounter a few examples of incorrect and irrelevant answers. Hopefully, these examples will help you keep in mind that even if ChatGPT’s responses seem logical at first sight, they’re not always correct. Sometimes the errors in a response are so subtle that you’ll spot them only if you’re an expert programmer.
