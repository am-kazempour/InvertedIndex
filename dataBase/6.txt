Have you ever wondered how you can order a pizza online, check the weather forecast, or stream your favorite show on Netflix? If so, you’ve probably used a REST API without even knowing it. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and it’s a way of communicating between different systems on the web. 
In this article, we’ll explain what a REST API is, how it works, and why it’s so important in today’s world. By the end of this article, you’ll be able to impress your friends with your knowledge of REST APIs, and maybe even order a pizza faster.
An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and instructions that allows one system to interact with another system. For example, when you use an app on your phone, the app uses an API to communicate with the server and get the data it needs. An API defines what information can be exchanged, how it can be exchanged, and what format it should be in. An API makes it easier for developers to create applications that can work with different systems and platforms.
The guiding principles of REST API are a set of best practices and design principles that help ensure a consistent and efficient API. These principles are essential for creating a scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly API.
